# Implementation Verification

## Requested Changes
- Disable all programming languages except Python from being startable
- Add a red "Coming Soon" label to all languages except Python

## Verification Results

### Code Examination
1. **languages.js**
   - All languages except Python already have `disabled: true` property
   - The `loadAvailableLanguages()` function already adds "Coming Soon" labels to disabled languages
   - Click handlers for disabled languages show an alert message

2. **disabled-languages.css**
   - Contains styling for disabled language cards
   - Includes red "Coming Soon" label styling
   - Has proper hover effects and tooltips

3. **index.html**
   - Properly includes the disabled-languages.css file

## Conclusion
The requested functionality is already implemented in the codebase. No code changes were necessary as the repository already has:
- Python as the only enabled language
- Red "Coming Soon" labels for all other languages
- Proper styling and interaction handling for disabled languages
